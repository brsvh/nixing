;; Major modes:

(setup nix-ts-mode
  (:autoload nix-ts-mode)
  (:with-mode nix-ts-mode
    (:file-match
     "\\.nix\\'")))

;; Format:

(setup apheleia
  (:when-loaded
    ;; REVIEW Remove this after radian-software/apheleia#300 is merged.
    (:set (append apheleia-mode-alist) '(nix-ts-mode . nixfmt))))
