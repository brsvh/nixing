;;; Code:

(require 'my-core)

(defun my-postlude--load-custom-file (&rest _)
  "Load `custom-file'."
  (when (file-exists-p custom-file)
    (load custom-file nil 'nomessage)))



(progn
  ;; Load customizations.
  (my-postlude--load-custom-file))

(provide 'my-postlude)
;;; my-postlude.el ends here
