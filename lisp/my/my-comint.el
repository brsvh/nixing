;;; Commentary:

;; This file improves my common settings for interpreters.

;;; Code:

(require 'my-core)

(cl-eval-when (compile)
  (require 'comint))



(setup comint
  ;; Popup interpreter.
  (:snoc popper-reference-buffers
         'comint-mode))



(provide 'my-comint)
;;; my-comint.el ends here
