;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides support for workspace management, though not true
;; workspaces, only offering limited isolation.

;;; Code:

(require 'my-core)

(cl-eval-when (compile)
  (require 'activities)
  (require 'activities-list)
  (require 'activities-tabs))

;; Activities:

(setup activities-list
  (:autoload activities-list))

(setup activites-tabs
  (:autoload activities-tabs-mode))
