# Burgess Chang's Nix collections

I use Nix to continuously manage all my system environments. Some parts
of these environments can be reused in other users' environments, such
as Nix Packages, Nixpkgs Overlays, NixOS Modules, and Home Manager
Modules.

A series of documents here describe how to use them.

Have fun!
